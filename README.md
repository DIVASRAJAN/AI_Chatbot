# AI_Chatbot
AI chatbot created using rasa

python 3.9

rasa init command gives the files which we want to create a chatbot in the specified folder.
what we want to do is just change it based on our need.

I created this as a basic restaurant booking chatbot.

create a database in mysql add details of restaurants 
created two 'action' functions to fetch the location and the restaurants in the specific location based on user's interst
used 'slot' to remember what was the location which user said to verify at the final point
